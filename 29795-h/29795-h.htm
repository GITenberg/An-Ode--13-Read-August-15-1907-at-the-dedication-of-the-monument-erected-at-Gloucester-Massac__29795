They who maintained their rights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through storm and stress,</span><br />
And walked in all the ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That God made known,</span><br />
Led by no wandering lights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by no guess,</span><br />
Through dark and desolate days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of trial and moan:</span><br />
Here let their monument<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rise, like a word</span><br />
In rock commemorative<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 2]</span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our Land's youth;</span><br />
Of ways the Puritan went,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With soul love-spurred</span><br />
To suffer, die, and live<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For faith and truth.</span><br />
Here they the corner-stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Freedom laid;</span><br />
Here in their hearts' distress<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They lit the lights</span><br />
Of Liberty alone;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here, with God's aid,</span><br />
Conquered the wilderness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Secured their rights.</span><br />
Not men, but giants, they,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who wrought with toil</span><br />
And sweat of brawn and brain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their freehold here;</span><br />
Who, with their blood, each day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hallowed the soil.</span><br />
And left it without stain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And without fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">II.</span></p>

<p>Yea; here, from men like these,<br />
Our country had its stanch beginning;<br />
Hence sprang she with the ocean breeze<br />
And pine scent in her hair;<br />
Deep in her eyes the winning,<br />
The far-off winning of the unmeasured West;<br />
And in her heart the care,<br />
The young unrest,<br />
Of all that she must dare,<br />
Ere as a mighty Nation she should stand<br />
Towering from sea to sea,<br />
From land to mountained land,<br />
One with the imperishable beauty of the stars<br />
In absolute destiny;<br />
Part of that cosmic law, no shadow mars,<br />
To which all freedom runs,<br />
That wheels the circles of the worlds and suns<br />
Along their courses through the vasty night,<br />
Irrevocable and eternal as is Light.</p>

<p>What people has to-day<br />
Such faith as launched and sped,<br />
With psalm and prayer, the Mayflower on its way?&mdash;<br />
Such faith as led<br />
The Dorchester fishers to this sea-washed point,<br />
This granite headland of Cape Ann?<br />
Where first they made their bed,<br />
Salt-blown and wet with brine,<br />
In cold and hunger, where the storm-wrenched pine<br />
Clung to the rock with desperate footing. They,<br />
With hearts courageous whom hope did anoint,<br />
Despite their tar and tan,<br />
Worn of the wind and spray,<br />
Seem more to me than man,<br />
With their unconquerable spirits.&mdash;Mountains may<br />
Succumb to men like these, to wills like theirs,&mdash;<br />
The Puritan's tenacity to do;<br />
The stubbornness of genius;&mdash;holding to<br />
Their purpose to the end,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span>No New-World hardship could deflect or bend;&mdash;<br />
That never doubted in their worst despairs,<br />
But steadily on their way<br />
Held to the last, trusting in God, who filled<br />
Their souls with fire of faith that helped them build<br />
A country, greater than had ever thrilled<br />
Man's wildest dreams, or entered in<br />
His highest hopes. 'Twas this that helped them win<br />
In spite of danger and distress,<br />
Through darkness and the din<br />
Of winds and waves, unto a wilderness,<br />
Savage, unbounded, pathless as the sea,<br />
That said, "Behold me! I am free!"<br />
Giving itself to them for greater things<br />
Than filled their souls with dim imaginings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">IV.</span></p>

<p>Let History record their stalwart names,<br />
And catalogue their fortitude, whence grew,<br />
Swiftly as running flames,<br />
Cities and civilization:<br />
How from a meeting-house and school,<br />
A few log-huddled cabins, Freedom drew<br />
Her rude beginnings. Every pioneer station,<br />
Each settlement, though primitive of tool,<br />
Had in it then the making of a Nation;<br />
Had in it then the roofing of the plains<br />
With traffic; and the piercing through and through<br />
Of forests with the iron veins<br />
Of industry.<br />
Would I could make you see<br />
How these, laboriously,<br />
These founders of New England, every hour<br />
Faced danger, death, and misery,<br />
Conquering the wilderness;<br />
With supernatural power<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]</span>Changing its features; all its savage glower<br />
Of wild barbarity, fierce hate, duress,<br />
To something human, something that could bless<br />
Mankind with peace and lift its heart's elation;<br />
Something at last that stood<br />
For universal brotherhood,<br />
Astonishing the world, a mighty Nation,<br />
Hewn from the solitude.&mdash;<br />
Iron of purpose as of faith and daring,<br />
And of indomitable will,<br />
With axe and hymn-book still I see them faring,<br />
The Saxon Spirit of Conquest at their side<br />
With sword and flintlock; still I see them stride,<br />
As to some Roundhead rhyme,<br />
Adown the aisles of Time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">V.</span></p>

<p>Can praise be simply said of such as these?<br />
Such men as Standish, Winthrop, Endicott?<br />
Such souls as Roger Conant and John White?<br />
Rugged and great as trees,<br />
The oaks of that New World with which their lot<br />
Was cast forever, proudly to remain.<br />
That world in which each name still stands, a light<br />
To beacon the Ship of State through stormy seas.<br />
Can praise be simply said<br />
Of him, the younger Vane,<br />
Puritan and patriot,<br />
Whose dedicated head<br />
Was laid upon the block<br />
In thy name, Liberty!<br />
Can praise be simply said of such as he!<br />
Needs must the soul unlock<br />
All gates of eloquence to sing of these.<br />
Such periods,<br />
Such epic melodies,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]</span>As holds the utterance of the earlier gods,<br />
The lords of song, one needs<br />
To sing the praise of these!<br />
No feeble music, tinklings frail of glass;<br />
No penny trumpetings; twitterings of brass,<br />
The moment's effort, shak'n from pigmy bells,<br />
Ephemeral drops from small Pierian wells,<br />
With which the Age relieves a barren hour.<br />
But such large music, such melodious power,<br />
As have our cataracts,<br />
Pouring the iron facts,<br />
The giant acts<br />
Of these: such song as have our rock-ridged deep<br />
And mountain steeps,<br />
When winds, like clanging eagles, sweep the storm<br />
On tossing wood and farm:<br />
Such eloquence as in the torrent leaps,&mdash;<br />
Where the hoarse canyon sleeps,<br />
Holding the heart with its terrific charm,<br />
Carrying its roaring message to the town,&mdash;<br />
To voice their high achievement and renown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">VI.</span></p>

<p>Long, long ago, beneath heaven's stormy slope,<br />
In deeds of faith and hope,<br />
Our fathers laid Freedom's foundations here,<br />
And raised, invisible, vast,&mdash;<br />
Embodying naught of doubt or fear,<br />
A monument whose greatness shall outlast<br />
The future, as the past,<br />
Of all the Old World's dynasties and kings.&mdash;<br />
A symbol of all things<br />
That we would speak, but cannot say in words,<br />
Of those who first began our Nation here,<br />
Behold, we now would rear!<br />
A different monument! a thought, that girds<br />
Itself with granite; dream made visible<br />
In rock and bronze to tell<br />
To all the Future what here once befell;<br />
Here where, unknown to them,<br />
A tree took root; a tree of wondrous stem;<br />
The tree of high ideals, which has grown,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span>And has not withered since its seed was sown,<br />
Was planted here by them in this new soil,<br />
Who watered it with tears and blood and toil:<br />
An heritage we mean to hold,<br />
Keeping it stanch and beautiful as of old.&mdash;<br />
For never a State,<br />
Or People, yet was great<br />
Without its great ideals;&mdash;branch and root<br />
Of the deep tree of life where bud and blow<br />
The dreams, the thoughts, that grow<br />
To deeds, the glowing fruit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">VII.</span></p>

<p>The morn, that breaks its heart of gold<br />
Above the purple hills;<br />
The eve, that spills<br />
Its nautilus splendor where the sea is rolled;<br />
The night, that leads the vast procession in<br />
Of stars and dreams,&mdash;<br />
The beauty that shall never die or pass:&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span>The winds, that spin<br />
Of rain the misty mantles of the grass,<br />
And thunder-raiment of the mountain-streams;<br />
The sunbeams, needling with gold the dusk<br />
Green cowls of ancient woods;<br />
The shadows, thridding, veiled with musk,<br />
The moon-pathed solitudes,<br />
Call to my Fancy, saying, "Follow! follow!"<br />
Till, following, I see,&mdash;<br />
Fair as a cascade in a rainbowed hollow,&mdash;<br />
A dream, a shape, take form,<br />
Clad on with every charm,&mdash;<br />
The vision of that Ideality,<br />
Which lured the pioneer in wood and hill,<br />
And beckoned him from earth and sky;<br />
The dream that cannot die,<br />
Their children's children did fulfill.<br />
In stone and iron and wood,<br />
Out of the solitude,<br />
And by a forthright act<br />
Create a mighty fact&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span>A Nation, now that stands<br />
Clad on with hope and beauty, strength and song,<br />
Eternal, young, and strong,<br />
Planting her heel on Wrong,<br />
Her starry banner in triumphant hands....<br />
Within her face the rose<br />
Of Alleghany dawns;<br />
Limbed with Alaskan snows,<br />
Floridian starlight in her eyes,&mdash;<br />
Eyes stern as steel yet tender as a fawn's,&mdash;<br />
And in her hair<br />
The rapture of her rivers; and the dare,<br />
As perishless as truth,<br />
That o'er the crags of her Sierras flies,<br />
Urging the eagle ardor through her veins,<br />
Behold her where,<br />
Around her radiant youth,<br />
The spirits of the cataracts and plains,<br />
The genii of the floods and forests, meet,<br />
In rainbow mists circling her brow and feet:<br />
The forces vast that sit<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span>In session round her; powers paraclete,<br />
That guard her presence; awful forms and fair.<br />
Making secure her place;<br />
Guiding her surely as the worlds through space<br />
Do laws sidereal; edicts, thunder-lit,<br />
Of skyed eternity, in splendor borne<br />
On planetary wings of night and morn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">VIII.</span></p>

<p>Behold her! this is she!<br />
Beautiful as morning on the summer sea,<br />
Yet terrible as is the elemental gold<br />
That cleaves the tempest and in angles clings<br />
About its cloudy temples.&mdash;Manifold<br />
The dreams of daring in her fearless gaze,<br />
Fixed on the future's days;<br />
And round her brow, a strand of astral beads,<br />
Her soul's resplendent deeds;<br />
And at her front one star,<br />
Refulgent hope,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span>Like that on morning's slope,<br />
Beaconing the world afar.&mdash;<br />
From her high place she sees<br />
Her long procession of accomplished acts.<br />
Cloud-wing'd refulgences<br />
Of thoughts in steel and stone, of marble dreams,<br />
Lift up tremendous battlements,<br />
Sun-blinding, built of facts;<br />
While in her soul she seems,<br />
Listening, to hear, as from innumerable tents,<br />
&AElig;onian thunder, wonder, and applause<br />
Of all the heroic ages that are gone;<br />
Feeling secure<br />
That, as her Past, her Future shall endure,<br />
As did her Cause<br />
When redly broke the dawn<br />
Of fierce rebellion, and, beneath its star,<br />
The firmaments of war<br />
Poured down infernal rain,<br />
And North and South lay bleeding 'mid their slain.<br />
And now, no less, shall her Cause still prevail,<br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span>More so in peace than war,<br />
Through the thrilled wire and electric rail,<br />
Carrying her message far;<br />
Shaping her dream<br />
Within the brain of steam,<br />
That, with a myriad hands,<br />
Labors unceasingly, and knits her lands<br />
In firmer union; joining plain and stream<br />
With steel; and binding shore to shore<br />
With bands of iron;&mdash;nerves and arteries,<br />
Along whose adamant forever pour<br />
Her concrete thoughts, her tireless energies.</p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p class="center">ANNISQUAM</p>

<div class="poem">Old days, old ways, old homes beside the sea;<br />
Old gardens with old-fashioned flowers aflame,<br />
Poppy, petunia, and many a name<br />
Of many a flower of fragrant pedigree.<br />
Old hills that glow with blue- and barberry,<br />
And rocks and pines that stand on guard, the same.<br />
Immutable, as when the Pilgrim came,<br />
And here laid firm foundations of the Free.<br />
The sunlight makes the dim dunes hills of snow,<br />
And every vessel's sail a twinkling wing<br />
Glancing the violet ocean far away:<br />
The world is full of color and of glow;<br />
A mighty canvas whereon God doth fling<br />
The flawless picture of a perfect day.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center">"THE HIGHLANDS," ANNISQUAM</p>

<div class="poem">Here, from the heights, among the rocks and pines,<br />
The sea and shore seem some tremendous page<br />
Of some vast book, great with our heritage,<br />
Breathing the splendor of majestic lines.<br />
Yonder the dunes speak silver; yonder shines<br />
The ocean's sapphire word; there, gray with age,<br />
The granite writes its lesson, strong and sage;<br />
And there the surf its rhythmic passage signs.<br />
The winds, that sweep the page, that interlude<br />
Its majesty with music; and the tides,<br />
That roll their thunder in, that period<br />
Its mighty rhetoric, deep and dream-imbued,<br />
Are what it seems to say, of what abides,<br />
Of what's eternal, and of what is God.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<p class="center">STORM AT ANNISQUAM</p>

<div class="poem">The sun sinks scarlet as a barberry.<br />
Far off at sea one vessel lifts a sail,<br />
Hurrying to harbor from the coming gale,<br />
That banks the west above a choppy sea.<br />
The sun is gone; the tide is flowing free;<br />
The bay is opaled with wild light; and pale<br />
The lighthouse spears its flame now; through a veil<br />
That falls about the sea mysteriously.<br />
Out there she sits and mutters of her dead,<br />
Old Ocean; of the stalwart and the strong,<br />
Skipper and fisher whom her arms dragged down:<br />
Before her now she sees their ghosts; o'erhead,<br />
As gray as rain, their wild wrecks sweep along,<br />
And all night long lay siege to this old town.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p class="center">FROM COVE TO COVE</p>

<div class="poem">The road leads up a hill through many a brake,<br />
Blueberry and barberry, bay and sassafras,<br />
By an abandoned quarry, where, like glass,<br />
A round pool lies; an isolated lake,<br />
A mirror for what presences, that make<br />
Their wildwood toilets here! The road is grass<br />
Gray-scarred with stone: great bowlders, as we pass,<br />
Slope burly shoulders towards us. Cedars shake<br />
Wild balsam from their tresses; there and here<br />
Clasping a glimpse of ocean and of shore<br />
In arms of swaying green. Below, at last,<br />
Beside the sea, with derrick and with pier,<br />
By heaps of granite, noise of drill and bore,<br />
A Cape Ann town, towering with many a mast.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p class="center">V.</p>

<p class="center">PASTURES BY THE SEA</p>

<div class="poem">Here where the coves indent the shore and fall<br />
And fill with ebb and flowing of the tides;<br />
Whereon some barge rocks or some dory rides,<br />
By which old orchards bloom, or, from the wall,<br />
Pelt every lane with fruit; where gardens, tall<br />
With roses, riot; swift my gladness glides<br />
To that old pasture where the mushroom hides,<br />
The chicory blooms and Peace sits mid them all.<br />
Fenced in with rails and rocks, its emerald slopes,&mdash;<br />
Ribbed with huge granite,&mdash;where the placid cows<br />
Tinkle a browsing bell, roll to a height<br />
Wherefrom the sea, bright as adventuring hopes,<br />
Swept of white sails and plowed of foaming prows,<br />
Leaps like a Nereid on the ravished sight.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p class="center">THE DUNES</p>

<div class="poem">Far as the eye can see, in domes and spires,<br />
Buttress and curve, ruins of shifting sand,&mdash;<br />
In whose wild making wind and sea took hand,&mdash;<br />
The white dunes stretch. The wind, that never tires,<br />
Striving for strange effects that he admires,<br />
Changes their form from time to time; the land<br />
Forever passive to his mad demand,<br />
And to the sea's, who with the wind conspires.<br />
Here, as on towers of desolate cities, bay<br />
And wire-grass grow, wherein no insect cries,<br />
Only a bird, the swallow of the sea,<br />
That homes in sand. I hear it far away<br />
Crying&mdash;or is it some lost soul that flies,<br />
Above the land, ailing unceasingly?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p class="center">VII.</p>

<p class="center">BY THE SUMMER SEA</p>

<div class="poem">Sunlight and shrill cicada and the low,<br />
Slow, sleepy kissing of the sea and shore,<br />
And rumor of the wind. The morning wore<br />
A sullen face of fog that lifted slow,<br />
Letting her eyes gleam through of grayest glow;<br />
Wearing a look like that which once she wore<br />
When, Gloucesterward from Dogtown there, they bore<br />
Some old witchwife with many a gibe and blow.<br />
But now the day has put off every care,<br />
And sits at peace beside the smiling sea,<br />
Dreaming bright dreams with lazy-lidded eyes:<br />
One is a castle, precipiced in air,<br />
And one a golden galleon&mdash;can it be<br />
'Tis but the cloudworld of the sunset skies?</div>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
